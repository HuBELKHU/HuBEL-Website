abstract: This research expands our focus from individual buildings to the urban scale, addressing critical challenges of climate change and urban sustainability. We investigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, analyzing its causes, predicting its intensity, and assessing its impact on public health and energy consumption. A key component of this work is evaluating tangible mitigation strategies, including the application of sustainable materials (e.g., cool materials, PCMs) and the integration of green infrastructure (e.g., green roofs, urban forestry). This research connects material science with strategic urban planning to create more resilient and sustainable built environments.
