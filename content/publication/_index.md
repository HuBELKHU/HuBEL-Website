    <p>
      This comprehensive research area places the human at the center of building design and
operation. We investigate the multifaceted aspects of Indoor Environmental Quality
(IEQ)—including visual, thermal, and air quality—and their collective impact on occupant well-
being, satisfaction, and productivity. Our work explores the nuanced relationship between the
physical environment (e.g., daylighting, window views) and subjective human perception, while
also modeling occupant behavior to bridge the gap between predicted and actual building
performance. By developing advanced daylighting systems, adaptive comfort models, and
holistic IEQ assessment frameworks, we aim to create indoor environments that are not only
energy-efficient but also truly responsive to the needs of their occupants.
