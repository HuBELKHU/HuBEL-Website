---

Our research is dedicated to advancing the sustainability and performance of buildings and
cities by focusing on the intricate interplay between energy systems, environmental quality, and
human well-being. We employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced modeling,
real-world monitoring, AI and data-driven approaches and human-centric evaluation to create
energy-efficient, comfortable, and healthy indoor and outdoor environments.

### 1. Occupant behaviour & Comfort

<br>

**Overview:** 

This comprehensive research area places the human at the center of building design and
operation. We investigate the multifaceted aspects of Indoor Environmental Quality
(IEQ)—including visual, thermal, and air quality—and their collective impact on occupant well-
being, satisfaction, and productivity. Our work explores the nuanced relationship between the
physical environment (e.g., daylighting, window views) and subjective human perception, while
also modeling occupant behavior to bridge the gap between predicted and actual building
performance. By developing advanced daylighting systems, adaptive comfort models, and
holistic IEQ assessment frameworks, we aim to create indoor environments.

### 2. Building Energy Performance

<br>

**Overview:** 

This foundational research theme is centered on improving energy efficiency across the building
stock through rigorous analysis and data-driven modeling. We develop and apply sophisticated
methodologies for energy benchmarking, allowing for the robust comparison and performance
evaluation of buildings. A key focus is on reducing the &quot;performance gap&quot; by creating advanced
calibration techniques that align simulation predictions with real-world operational data. Our
work includes the creation of reference energy models for various building typologies, providing
the essential frameworks needed to support evidence-based energy policies, building codes,
