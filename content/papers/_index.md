Our research is dedicated to advancing the sustainability and performance of buildings and
cities by focusing on the intricate interplay between energy systems, environmental quality, and
human well-being. We employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced modeling,
real-world monitoring, AI and data-driven approaches and human-centric evaluation to create
energy-efficient, comfortable, and healthy indoor and outdoor environments.

### 1. Occupant behaviour & Indoor Environmental Quality

<br>

**Overview:** 

This comprehensive research area places the human at the center of building design and
operation. We investigate the multifaceted aspects of Indoor Environmental Quality
(IEQ)—including visual, thermal, and air quality—and their collective impact on occupant well-
being, satisfaction, and productivity. Our work explores the nuanced relationship between the
physical environment (e.g., daylighting, window views) and subjective human perception, while
also modeling occupant behavior to bridge the gap between predicted and actual building
performance. By developing advanced daylighting systems, adaptive comfort models, and
holistic IEQ assessment frameworks, we aim to create indoor environments.

### 2. Building Energy Performance Analysis & Modeling

<br>

**Overview:** 

This foundational research theme is centered on improving energy efficiency across the building
stock through rigorous analysis and data-driven modeling. We develop and apply sophisticated
methodologies for energy benchmarking, allowing for the robust comparison and performance
evaluation of buildings. A key focus is on reducing the &quot;performance gap&quot; by creating advanced
calibration techniques that align simulation predictions with real-world operational data. Our
work includes the creation of reference energy models for various building typologies, providing
the essential frameworks needed to support evidence-based energy policies, building codes,
and high-performance design.

### 3. Intelligent HVAC Systems & Control

<br>

**Overview:** 

This research concentrates on the core of building energy consumption: Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. We focus on enhancing the performance of next-
generation HVAC technologies through advanced design, optimization, and intelligent control
logic. Our work involves developing dynamic, load-responsive control strategies for systems like
Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) and Electric Heat Pumps (EHP) to maximize efficiency under
variable operating conditions. The goal is to create highly responsive and energy-efficient HVAC
solutions that maintain optimal indoor comfort while minimizing operational costs and
environmental impact.

**Overview:** 

This research expands our focus from individual buildings to the urban scale, addressing critical
challenges of climate change and urban sustainability. We investigate the Urban Heat Island
(UHI) phenomenon, analyzing its causes, predicting its intensity, and assessing its impact on
public health and energy consumption. A key component of this work is evaluating tangible
mitigation strategies, including the application of sustainable materials (e.g., cool materials,
PCMs) and the integration of green infrastructure (e.g., green roofs, urban forestry). This
