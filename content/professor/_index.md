    <p>
      Geun Young Yun is a building scientist working in the area of the design, operation, and evaluation of sustainable buildings and neighbourhoods. He is professor of building science at Department of Architectural Engineering of Kyung Hee University (KHU), South Korea. After obtaining BEng and MEng degrees from Chung Ang University, he worked as an environmental consultant for sustainable building design in both South Korea and UK. His PhD work at University of Cambridge is a critical, new component of developing the understanding of the energy and environmental performance of buildings with respect to the role of human agency, obtained from a combined approach to field measurement and statistical simulation.

  He has been leading the Human Behaviour and Energy Laboratory (HuBEL) at Kyung Hee University since 2010. A central aim of HuBEL is contribute to creating sustainable and healthy buildings and neighbourhoods by carrying out innovative research in the area of human behaviour, comfort, artificial intelligence, energy efficiency, energy and environment, urban climate, renewable energy and architectural lighting.
