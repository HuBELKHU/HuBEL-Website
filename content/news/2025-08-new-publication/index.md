The Human Behaviour and Energy Laboratory (HuBEL) at Kyung Hee University is pleased to
announce the expansion of our team. On September 1st, we were delighted to welcome **Ali
Muzahir, Ayeen M. Khan, Da Eun Jung, and Lewis Nsengeyukuri** to our lab.

Under the leadership of Professor Geun Young Yun, HuBEL continues to build on its strong
foundation of interdisciplinary research. The addition of our new members brings valuable new
skills and diverse perspectives that will enhance our ongoing work to understand human
behaviour and advance sustainable energy and climate solutions at building and urban scales.

This growth marks an exciting new phase for the lab. The fusion of our established expertise
with fresh insights will invigorate our collaborative environment and accelerate our progress in
tackling complex global challenges. By expanding our team, we are reinforcing our commitment
to producing innovative, high-impact research.

We are confident that the contributions of our new colleagues will be instrumental as we
continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. We look forward to a future of shared success
and groundbreaking discoveries.

Welcome to the team!
